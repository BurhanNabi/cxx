# C/C++ Data Structures and Algorithms


## About
This repository contains some data-structures and algorithms. All source has been written in a **Test Driven** manner. Repeated process of writing tests and then making sure they work were followed.
**BOOST** library is used to write the unit tests.

## How to run the code
Running the code is basically running the tests. Makefiles do all the work, you just have to make sure the dependencies are met and then run the executables.
```bash
$ make
$ ./test
$ make clean
```
